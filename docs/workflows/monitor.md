# Monitor (Dashboard)

**Page**: `Dashboard` (Home)

## Overview
The Dashboard is your command center, providing a high-level overview of the security posture. It is designed to answer the question: *"Is everything okay right now?"*

## Key Metrics

*   **Total Active Cases**: The number of security incidents currently being worked on.
*   **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: The average time taken to resolve cases. Lower is better.
*   **Events per Second (EPS)**: Indicates the volume of logs being ingested. A sudden drop may indicate a data collection issue.

## Visualizations

*   **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**: A coverage map showing which tactics and techniques have been detected recently.
*   **Alert Severity Distribution**: A breakdown of alerts by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
