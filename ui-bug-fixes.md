# UI Bug Fixes - Incremental Approach

## Test Results Summary
- ✅ 45 buttons working
- ❌ 20 buttons failed  
- 🔍 Need to identify and fix each issue

## Identified Issues

### 1. Session/Logout Problems

### 2. Page-Specific Issues

## Fix Strategy
1. Get detailed failure list
2. Group by issue type
3. Fix highest impact first
4. Test each fix
5. Deploy incrementally

## Current Status
